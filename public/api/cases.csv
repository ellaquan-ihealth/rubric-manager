2. Patient is coping with the emotional and mental weight of a new diabetes diagnosis; important to validate that it‚Äôs normal to feel this way and healthy. Ignoring emotions can cause challenges with behavior changes later. 
3. Renforce positive lifestyle: patient is following doctor‚Äôs orders and watching sugar intake, showing strong commitment to managing health. Also has already on a FODMAP diet, which is likely already diabetic friendly. 
5. Patient is holding off on exercise until feeling better; it's important to offer to help patient build a gradual, realistic plan to restart safely or even a goal to get back on track but they can decide if this is something they want to explore of not.

2.

2. FBG = 183 mg/dL (elevated)
3. Target FBG <130 mg/dL
","1. Patient just started basal insulin (Lantus 10U) and is on day 1 of insulin therapy 
2. FBG = 183 mg/dL which is elevated. Although insulin works quickly, this elevation is expected since insulin just began and we want to give more time for insulin to start to work at it's maximum potency
3. Pt just learned to inject insulin from an RN at the VA, likely still practicing site rotation and technique. Recnogize that patient not a fan of needles and this is normal when starting insulin so important to normalize and reinforcing tips to reduce discomfort and build confidence such as injection sites and needle size. 
4. Because pt's BG is still high and insulin has just started, CDCES encourages patient with insulin magement plan that is gradual until BG can become more controlled. Plan to titrate by +1 unit daily until FBG <130 mg/dL and watch for hypoglycemia
5. CDCES to follow weekly and reinforce FBG goal <130 mg/dL, knowing it may take time to observe gradual changes
6. Develop follow up/monitoring plan: confirm patient understands signs of hypoglycemia, how to treat, and when to call. Encourage continued monitoring. Offer reassurance, resistance and anxiety is common with first insulin starts and can follow-up on compliance in 1-week.

üí¨ Staff [12:07] The difference you're seeing between your CGM (62) and your glucometer (103) isn‚Äôt unusual, especially when blood sugar is changing quickly. CGMs measure glucose in the fluid between your cells, so there‚Äôs often a slight lag compared to fingerstick readings, which measure directly from the blood.

This means the CGM can lag behind the fingerstick reading by about 5‚Äì20 minutes. So if your blood sugar is rising or falling, the CGM might read lower or higher than the glucometer in that moment.

In this case, your glucometer is likely the more accurate number for making real-time decisions. Let me know if you‚Äôre noticing this kind of difference often, and I‚Äôm happy to help talk through patterns or tips to make things easier!

2. Clinican did a great job to validate patient and patient has a clear understanding of how their changes in lifestyle impact their BG. Also encouraging to keep active. 
3. To take one step further and keep the patient engaged, the clinician could have asked: 
- Let me know if you want any alternatives for scone or other food options that may be more balanced and not spike your BG later? 
- Encouraged hydration.
- Helped the patient with the timing of the scone -- i.e. when their BG is usually the lowest based on CGM data

hi! today I decided to check my ketones the reading was 1.1. so I‚Äôve been keeping my carbs low, And my bg has been low for me, my question is, is 1.1 bad for me because i‚Äôm a type 2 diabetic?

üë§ Patient [08:15]

üë§ Patient [08:16]
but later I found out that ketones can be bad, can you explain why?

üí¨ Staff [09:27]
Hi John, Your ketone level is slightly elevated‚Äînormally it should be below 0.6 mmol/L. Elevated ketones can indicate that the body isn‚Äôt getting enough insulin, which causes it to break down fat for energy. When ketone levels become too high, it can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. Generally, the keto diet is more suitable for short-term use. it's better to follow a more balanced, less restrictive long-term plan like the Mediterranean or DASH diet for BG management.

Have you noticed any symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or fruity-smelling breath? While fatigue can sometimes be a sign of elevated ketones, I encourage you to discuss this with your healthcare provider for further evaluation.

üí¨ Staff [09:53]
Great to hear! On a keto diet, we typically aim to keep carbs around 20‚Äì25g per meal to stay in nutritional ketosis.

If you're on balanced meal plan, it's also great to keep your complex carbohydrates around 45‚Äì60g per meal, and pair them with protein and non-starchy vegetables to help stabilize blood sugar levels.

A helpful tip for managing blood glucose is to do cardio exercises after meals‚Äîthis can help stimulate insulin sensitivity and bring down post-meal blood sugar.

5. Hydration
-Estimated daily fluid intake (in ounces)
-Type of fluids consumed (e.g., water, coffee, electrolyte drinks)
-Any recent changes in fluid intake or fluid losses (e.g., sweating, diarrhea)

6. Nutrition
-Current carb intake (approx. grams/day or % of meals)

-Meal/snack pattern and macronutrient balance
-Use of shakes, bars, or meal replacements

7. Device & Monitoring

8. Psychosocial & Behavior
-Frustration with tech, dietary barriers, or support system
-Family-related disruptions to food choices or routine
-Motivation level and self-identified goals (e.g., energy, weight, A1C)
-Confidence in managing diabetes and dietary changes","Step 1: Address the Primary Concern Clearly
-Respond to the patient‚Äôs question directly: ‚ÄúYes, frequent urination can happen when you cut carbs.‚ÄùOR ‚ÄúNo, this is not a known side effect of Rybelsus.‚Äù
-Clarify that the patient is likely experiencing water loss due to early-stage keto, not medication side effects
-Reassure that this symptom is common and typically short-term in low-carb transitions

Step 2: Rule Out Safety Concerns
-Review BG values: 179 mg/dL (post-breakfast) and 144 mg/dL (post-dinner)
-Confirm these do not indicate severe hyperglycemia or osmotic diuresis
-Check for red flags: no nausea, vomiting, fruity breath, confusion, or abdominal pain
-Conclude there is no immediate concern for DKA or urgent glycemic event

Step 3: Assess Medication and Supplement Use
-Note that patient recently started Rybelsus (GLP-1), which can cause GI symptoms but not excess urination
-Consider possible contributions from other meds (e.g., SGLT2 inhibitors like Farxiga)
-Ask for full med list to rule out additive effects
-Confirm patient is using thiamine and liquid mineral supplements for cramping, with self-reported relief

Step 4: Explain the Likely Cause of Frequent Urination
-Educate that cutting carbs depletes glycogen, which releases stored water and sodium
-Explain this can lead to increased urination for the first few days
-Reinforce that the symptoms are expected and typically improve with hydration and mineral support
-Explain how Rybelsus works: slows digestion, reduces appetite, lowers BG but not linked to diuresis

Step 5: Clarify Hydration and Daily Intake
-Ask ‚ÄúHow many ounces of water or fluids are you drinking each day?‚Äù
-Explore types of fluids consumed (water, coffee, electrolyte drinks)
-Explain that both underhydration and overhydration without electrolytes can worsen cramping and fatigue
-Encourage balanced hydration with added sodium and minerals during keto adaptation

Step 6: Review Self-Monitoring and BG Device Issues
-Acknowledge tech issues with the BG meter and offer to help troubleshoot
-Encourage continued daily BG checks during diet and med adjustments
-Suggest logging BG, fluid intake, and symptom patterns over the next few days
-Ask if the patient has access to a backup meter or alternate testing method

Step 7: Personalize Support Based on Psychosocial Context
-Recognize patient‚Äôs motivation and strong knowledge of keto and diabetes
-Acknowledge frustration with outside influence (family) and affirm independence
-Tone should respect autonomy and use language like ‚ÄúYou clearly know what works for you, let‚Äôs fine-tune it‚Äù
-Encourage continued self-awareness and let patient know when to reach out (e.g., if urination worsens or persists beyond 7‚Äì10 days)"

That's awesome! I'm really glad to hear you're making some positive changes to your diet. For your sweet tooth, one tip is to try exercising after eating sweets. It can help improve insulin sensitivity and bring down your blood sugar levels. Instead of a chocolate bar, you could opt for dark chocolate with almonds or other nuts, and try to stick to a small handful.

In addition to low-GI black rice, have you considered trying cauliflower rice? It's a nutrient-rich, low-carb alternative that works great for meals while still being filling and satisfying. Keep up the great work! üòä","Time: 2025-02-13 [1:52]

 -Flag sustained hyperglycemia as a clinical risk that may require medication adjustment
 -Plan for closer monitoring of fasting and post-dinner trends

Step 2: Clarify Medication Use and Timing
 -Ask: ‚ÄúWhat time do you take your Ozempic and insulin each day?‚Äù and clearly document 
 -Confirm Ozempic is taken weekly on Wednesdays; check for any GI side effects or appetite change
 -Clarify Novolog use: is it truly only used when BG >200 mg/dL? Is it taken with food or as a correction?
 -Assess if Novolog is used too late after eating, or if doses are skipped due to food uncertainty
 -Determine if other medications (e.g., Metformin, basal insulin) are in use or missing

Step 3: Evaluate Meal Timing and Food Patterns
 -Ask about timing and size of dinner over the past 2‚Äì3 days, especially on Sunday and Monday
 -Assess if late or high-fat dinners may be delaying post-meal glucose spikes
 -Clarify whether meals are truly ‚Äúthe same every day,‚Äù or if weekends differ in size or timing
 -Discuss that carbohydrate consistency can simplify insulin timing and improve control
 -Gently raise past examples of large meals and help patient build awareness of patterns

Step 4: Investigate Hunger and Satiety Patterns
 -Note patient still reports feeling hungry at night, despite being on Ozempic
 -Ask what types of foods are eaten in the evening; are meals lacking fat, fiber, or protein?
 -Consider that early GLP-1 use may not fully suppress appetite yet
 -Educate on strategies to reduce evening hunger, such as more balanced earlier meals

Step 5: Reinforce Positive Behavior and Target Monitoring
 -Praise patient for biking 30 minutes daily as this improves insulin sensitivity and is a great habit
 -Encourage more intentional tracking of late dinners and fasting BGs
 -Suggest patient note what time dinner and Novolog are taken, and monitor the following morning BG
 -Use these data to find any missed insulin-food mismatches

Step 6: Educate on GLP-1 Effects and Delayed Spikes
 -Explain how Ozempic slows gastric emptying, which can delay glucose absorption and insulin action
 -Teach that high-fat meals (e.g., red meat, cheese, fried foods) can cause delayed BG spikes; several hours after eating
 -Share practical swaps and focus on healthy monounsaturated fats (e.g., nuts, olive oil, avocado)
 -Offer article or visuals for reinforcement of these effects

Step 7: Plan for Follow-Up and Potential Escalation
 -If FBGs remain elevated in 1‚Äì2 weeks, suggest escalating to PCP to consider:
 -Increasing basal insulin
 -Titrating Ozempic to a higher dose
 -Recommend reviewing CGM trends, food log, and insulin timing before next visit
 -Use this data to adjust patient's care in some other way 
 -Refer the patient to a specialist"
